.SYNOPSIS
    Timestamped backup of the production database with retention pruning.
    Intended to run as a daily Scheduled Task (see Register-BackupTask.ps1),
    but can also be run by hand before a risky deploy.

.DESCRIPTION
    Writes a fresh <Database>_<timestamp>.bak under -BackupDir, verifies it with
    RESTORE VERIFYONLY, then deletes backups older than -RetentionDays. Uses
    Windows auth (-E), so the calling identity needs BACKUP rights on the
    instance (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM is a sysadmin by default on SQL Server).
